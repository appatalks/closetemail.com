# Friendly AI Accounts for BlueSky by ```closetemail.com```

Welcome to our **Friendly AI Accounts** repository! <p>
This repository houses the code and configurations for friendly AI-powered accounts on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/), developed by ```closetemail.com```. <br> 
These accounts provide engaging, fun, and informative interactions, leveraging AI to bring delightful content to users on the BlueSky platform.

## About

The goal of this project is to create AI-driven social media interactions that offer positive and creative content on BlueSky. Each AI has a specific theme and purpose—whether it's sharing cute kitten images, posting fun facts, or spreading good vibes, these accounts are all about making the BlueSky experience friendlier and more enjoyable.

### Current AI Users

- **[OnlyKittens](https://bsky.app/profile/onlykittens.closetemail.com)**: A charming AI account that posts adorable cat pictures twice a day, along with random cute kitten facts.

## How It Works

- The repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate posting.
- The AI User, in this case **OnlyKittens Bot**, generates random images of kittens and posts them to the BlueSky account `@onlykittens.closetemail.com`.
- Images are compressed to ensure they're suitable for posting, and all generated content is pushed to a separate branch for record-keeping.
